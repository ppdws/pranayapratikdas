I had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) under some of the most esteemed faculty members in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at NIT Rourkela. During this time, I was actively involved in conducting and co-supervising several undergraduate physics laboratory courses and postgraduate research projects. This role allowed me not only to reinforce my own conceptual understanding through teaching but also to engage with a diverse group of enthusiastic students, many of whom were a pleasure to mentor and assist in their academic journey.
