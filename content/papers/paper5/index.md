description: "This paper is under peer review."
summary: "The paper explores how exponential growth in OTOCs can occur even in the absence of classical indicators like potential maxima, revealing that such growth is instead closely linked to local density of states and the curvature of the potential's slope, rather than to chaos itself."

##### Abstract

The boundary of a billiard system plays a crucial role in shaping its dynamics, which may be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. When a boundary has varying curvature, it offers a unique setting to study the relation between classical chaos and quantum behaviour. In this study, we introduce two geometrically distinct billiards: a bean-shaped boundary and a peanut-shaped variant of Cassini ovals. These systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing walls with no neutral segments. Our study reveals a strong correlation between classical and quantum dynamics. Our analysis of billiard flow diagrams confirms sensitivity to initial conditions(ICs)—a defining feature of chaos. Poincar´e maps further show the phase space intricately woven with regions of chaotic motion and stability islands. Moving to the quantum domain, we employ nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and level spacing ratio as statistical measures to characterise chaos. Early time saturation in spectral complexity also supports an ergodic hierarchy in these systems. We observe a striking quantum phenomenon, i.e. eigenfunction scarring. This work bridges geometric boundary effects, classical hyperbolicity, and quantum ergodicity, offering a framework to engineer chaos in confined systems.
