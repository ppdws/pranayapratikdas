summary: "This article introduce a cyclically symmetric Thomas oscillator model coupled with Kuramoto‑type phase dynamics—dubbed “swarmalators”—that self‑organise into both crystalline and chaotic spatiotemporal patterns, offering a versatile paradigm for active fluids and pattern formation in active matter systems."

##### Abstract

In this letter, we demonstrate the cyclically symmetric Thomas oscillators as swarmalators and describe their possible collective dynamics. We achieve this by sewing Kuromoto-type phase dynamics to particle dynamics represented by the Thomas model. More precisely, this is equivalent to a non-linear particle aggregation model with cyclic symmetry of coordinates and position-dependent phase dynamics. The non-linear equations describe spatiotemporal patterns of crystalline order and chaotic randomness at two extreme values of the system parameter. This pattern is the outcome of non-linear self-organization, which leads to a new class of turbulent flow - active turbulence. We claim that this model can capture the dynamics of many naturally occurring microorganisms and micro-swimmers. The model described in this letter can be a prototypical model for understanding active systems and may shed light on the possibility of making novel materials(active matter) with exciting biomedical and industrial applications. The key to this is the understanding and control over the complex dynamics of active systems, an out-of-equilibrium system, which is potentially helpful in making functional materials, nano and micromachines.
