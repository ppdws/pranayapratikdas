summary: "This article introduce a cyclically symmetric Thomas oscillator model coupled with Kuramoto‑type phase dynamics—dubbed “swarmalators”—that self‑organise into both crystalline and chaotic spatiotemporal patterns, offering a versatile paradigm for active fluids and pattern formation in active matter systems."

## Overview

In this study, we demonstrate that cyclically symmetric Thomas oscillators can serve as swarmalators\textemdash agents exhibiting both swarming and phase synchronization\textemdash when coupled with Kuramoto-type phase dynamics. The resulting model represents a nonlinear particle aggregation system, characterised by cyclic spatial symmetry and position-dependent phase evolution. This coupling gives rise to rich spatio-temporal phenomena, including pre-hexatic or hexatic $2D$ structures, as well as chaotic turbulence under extreme parameter regimes. These emergent patterns result from nonlinear self-organization, manifesting as a form of active turbulence. Our analysis reveals that the nature and strength of inter-particle interactions, controlled by key system parameters, dictate the organization and dynamical behavior of the swarm. As a representative active, non-equilibrium system, this framework provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of collective motion and offers applications in the design of synthetic active materials and coordinated microscale systems.---
