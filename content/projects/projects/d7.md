## Overview

The widespread use of Virtual Reality(VR) has triggered many interesting practices in the field of visualization. This work presents one such visualization, Microvascular Network of a Mouse Brain in VR. Any VR application requires a certain amount of navigation irrespective of the visualization. This research has implemented multiple visual aids for navigation in non-human scale visualization of Microvascular Data. An experiment is presented to test how users experience and interpret these visual aids. The visual aids were designed to provide users with varying levels of information in terms of axis and location. Feedback from users indicates the effect of the visual aids on the navigation as well as their VR experience.
